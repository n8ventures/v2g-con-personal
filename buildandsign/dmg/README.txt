"N8's Video To GIF Converter (Beta).app is damaged and canâ€™t be opened"
"N8's Video To GIF Converter (Beta).app cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"

sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/N8's Video To GIF Converter (Beta).app"

OR

Go to your /Applications folder, then right-click the app and press 'Open', a pop-up will appear, then click 'Open' again.
