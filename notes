 - Done
- 2.5.0
 - Need to repurpose update module, (literally redirect to github for new release esp Mac).
  - Mac: Done.
  - Windows: NOT YET STARTED.
 - Need to release as part of Windows as well, and get the update module on that platform to be less aggressive.
 - Might rename windows title since we already have version on lower right.
    - Done
 - Figure out how to make GIFs animate via preview window (the main issue is splitting the gif up without ruining its current state)
    - Done
 - Add osascript exception (low prio/optional)
 - Hovertip Fix for MacOS: https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120083

- 2.4.1 (OSX)
need to dive into more on https://github.com/Saadmairaj/tkmacosx
KNOWN ISSUES
# tkinterdnd2 is buggy af. Might have to discontinue this if I dont figure out why it's freezing...
 - It might also be just a really buggy TCL/TK framework.
        - Things to try:
            - install OSX-ARM-only tkinterdnd2
            - reinistall frameworks and maybe python
            - downgrade python version.

- turns out. Not buggy. just needs a tkinter.root.update_idletasks() line on settings.window
# rare bug that doesn't change settings_window geometry after applying.
this might be one of those special case that somebody removed python in their laptops.
either way i just gotta package it more properly. i really think there's some mising dependencies
but python isn't flagging it properly.
