<h1>How To Use</h1>

### 1. Open up the program, either choose the "Choose File" Button, or drag the video on the window!

Since Version 4.0.0, you can batch-process multiple videos at once!

### 2. Choose your compression options
I'd like to point out that enabling/checking Motion Quality and/or Lossy Quality affects the overall quality.

Also, you'll also have this option pop up if it detects videos with alpha channels.

### 3. Preview the GIF
Click on the `Apply & Preview` button, to apply the settings you adjusted and a preview GIF should show along with the GIF Size and Dimensions.

If you don't like the current settings, you can always adjust it.

### 4. Save the GIF
Now just click the `Save As` button, and you're good to go.

But, let's backtrack a bit, remember on the first time the program opens the GIF, you see the `Quick Export` button? It's there if you just want something converted quick and done.
